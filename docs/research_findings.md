- Features include reading/writing data between various formats (CSV, Excel, SQL)
- Supports intelligent label-based slicing and fancy indexing
- Offers high-performance merging and joining of datasets
- Includes powerful group by engine for data aggregation and transformation
- Provides time series functionality
- GitHub Stars: 41K | Total Downloads: 1.6 billion

### Matplotlib
- Extensive library for creating fixed, interactive, and animated visualizations
- Similar functionality to MATLAB but with Python integration
- Supports various plot types: scatterplots, histograms, bar charts, error charts, boxplots
- Visualizations can be implemented with minimal code
- GitHub Stars: 18.7K | Total Downloads: 653 million

### Seaborn
- High-level interface built on Matplotlib for statistical visualizations
- Closely integrated with NumPy and pandas data structures
- Makes visualization an essential component of data exploration
- GitHub Stars: 11.6K | Total Downloads: 180 million

### Plotly
- Creates interactive data visualizations
- Web-based visualizations that can be saved as HTML or displayed in Jupyter notebooks
- Provides 40+ unique chart types including 3D charts and contour plots
- Better for interactive visualizations and dashboard-like graphics
- GitHub Stars: 14.7K | Total Downloads: 190 million

### Scikit-Learn
- Popular machine learning library built on NumPy, SciPy, and Matplotlib
- Simple and efficient tool for predictive data analysis
- Easy to use with straightforward API
- GitHub Stars: 57K | Total Downloads: 703 million

## Financial Data Analysis with Yahoo Finance API

### yfinance Library
- Pythonic way to fetch financial & market data from Yahoo Finance
- Latest version: 0.2.55 (as of Mar 20, 2025)
- Installation: `pip install yfinance`

### Main Components of yfinance
- `Ticker`: single ticker data
- `Tickers`: multiple tickers' data
- `download`: download market data for multiple tickers
- `Market`: get information about a market
- `Search`: quotes and news from search
- `Sector` and `Industry`: sector and industry information
- `EquityQuery` and `Screener`: build query to screen market

### Usage Examples
1. Retrieving real-time stock quotes:
```python
import yfinance as yf
ticker = yf.Ticker('AAPL')
todays_data = ticker.history(period='1d')
```

2. Retrieving historical data:
```python
# For a specific period
ticker = yf.Ticker('AAPL')
aapl_df = ticker.history(period='1y')

# For a specific date range
import datetime
startDate = datetime.datetime(2023, 1, 1)
endDate = datetime.datetime(2023, 12, 31)
apple_data = yf.Ticker('AAPL')
aapl_df = apple_data.history(start=startDate, end=endDate)
```

3. Retrieving multiple stocks data:
```python
import pandas as pd
import yfinance as yf
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

tickers_list = ['AAPL', 'WMT', 'IBM', 'MU', 'BA', 'AXP']
data = yf.download(tickers_list,'2023-1-1')['Adj Close']

# Plot cumulative returns
((data.pct_change()+1).cumprod()).plot(figsize=(10, 7))
plt.legend()
plt.title("Close Value", fontsize=16)
plt.ylabel('Cumulative Close Value', fontsize=14)
plt.xlabel('Time', fontsize=14)
plt.grid(which="major", color='k', linestyle='-.', linewidth=0.5)
plt.show()
```

### Common Errors and Troubleshooting
- Connection Issues: Handle with exception handling
- Invalid Ticker Symbol: Verify ticker symbols before making requests

## Yahoo Finance API from Datasource Module
The project has access to the following Yahoo Finance API endpoints:
1. YahooFinance/get_stock_chart - For fetching comprehensive stock market data
2. YahooFinance/get_stock_insights - For financial analysis data including technical indicators

These APIs can be integrated into our data analysis tool to provide powerful financial analysis capabilities.
